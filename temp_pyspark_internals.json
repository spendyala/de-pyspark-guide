        "3. **Manage Resources Efficiently**\n",
        "   - Set appropriate executor numbers and sizes\n",

        "   - Consider the right level of parallelism for your cluster\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Use Caching Strategically**\n",
        "   - Cache datasets used multiple times\n",

        "5. **Optimize Data Structure**\n",
        "   - Use appropriate data types (e.g., avoid strings when numbers would work)\n",
        "   - Consider using Kryo serialization for complex objects\n",
